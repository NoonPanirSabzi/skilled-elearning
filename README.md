## My process

### What I learned

1. Naming CSS Color Variables

   Two approaches:

   - **Semantic naming based on design role**  
      Name colors according to their purpose in the UI.
   - **Descriptive naming via color picker tools**  
      If the design role isn't clear, use tools like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/6f51fc) and assign a name based on appearance (e.g., `--color-indigo`).

2. Responsive Images with `srcset`, Media Queries, and Format Optimization

   How to Combine:

   - `srcset` for multiple resolutions.
   - `media queries` to adapt images to screen size.
   - Different **formats** (WebP, JPEG) and **pixel densities** for performance.

3. Gradients in CSS
   - Gradients are treated as **images**, not solid colors.
   - Use the `background` or `background-image` property—not `background-color`.

### I got Introduced To

1. **CSS Preprocessors (e.g., SCSS)**
2. **Tailwind CSS**

I may choose to use them in future projects.
